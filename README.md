# Urban Routes — Selenium Automated Testing

End-to-end automated tests for a taxi booking service, built on the Page Object Model.

--- 

## Project Description

This project contains end-to-end automated tests for the **Urban Routes** application, a taxi booking service. The tests verify the complete user flow from route selection to taxi reservation confirmation, including preference configuration, payment methods, and special trip requirements.

The project implements the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern to keep test code organized, maintainable, and reusable.

## Technologies and Techniques Used

### Technologies
- **Python 3.14.0** - Primary programming language
- **Selenium WebDriver 4.40.0** - Web browser automation framework
- **Pytest 9.0.0** - Python testing framework
- **ChromeDriver** - Driver for Google Chrome automation

### Techniques and Patterns
- **Page Object Model (POM)** - Design pattern to separate test logic from UI interaction
- **Explicit Waits** - Explicit waits to handle dynamic elements
- **XPath and CSS Selectors** - Element location strategies
- **Expected Conditions** - Wait conditions for element synchronization
- **Class-based Test Organization** - Test organization in classes for better structure

## Test Cases

The project includes 9 automated tests covering the complete booking flow:

| # | Test Case | Description |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | `test_set_route` | Set pickup and drop-off addresses |
| 2 | `test_comfort_fare` | Select Comfort fare option |
| 3 | `test_add_phone_number` | Add and verify phone number |
| 4 | `test_add_credit_card` | Add credit card as payment method |
| 5 | `test_comment_for_driver` | Add comment for the driver |
| 6 | `test_add_blanket_and_handkerchiefs` | Enable blanket and handkerchiefs option |
| 7 | `test_add_ice_cream` | Add ice cream to the order |
| 8 | `test_car_search_modal` | Verify taxi search modal appears |
| 9 | `test_driver_info_appears` | Verify driver information appears |

## Configuration

Test data is configured in `data.py`:
```python
urban_routes_url = 'https://...'
address_from = 'East 2nd Street, 601'
address_to = '1300 1st St'
phone_number = '+1 123 123 12 12'
card_number = '1234 5678 9100'
card_code = '111'
message_for_driver = 'I am wearing red'
```

---

## Important Notes

- Tests run **sequentially** following the user flow
- A **single browser session** is used for the entire test suite (session scope)
- **Explicit waits** ensure synchronization with dynamic elements
- The **POM pattern** facilitates test maintenance and updates
